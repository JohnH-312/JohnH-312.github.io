# Sites
This is my main repository containting my website. http://johnh-312.github.io/
It is hosted via my free github.io account. 

I'm planning on re-designing it to be more up-to date information, as well as more responsive and visually appealing. 
I also plan on figuring out how to make it more modular, as currently each page must be editied with each change.
- this would likely look like some kind of global CSS sheet, as well as possibly an inherited class or structure? I have to figure out still how to make this work in HTML.
